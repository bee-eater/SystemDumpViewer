# How to compile
1. Get Qt 6.4.2 via online installer from here: [Download](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source)
1. Install Qt with 11.2.0
1. Copy the qwt.dll from libs folder to you build/debug or build/release folder	

If you want to use another Qt version, you'll have to compile Qwt first. [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqFKwF6q7jQ)

## Lanugages
Qt supports translation in the code.
If you want text translated, use tr("mytext"), if not use QString("mytext")

Steps with bt_EditLanguages.bat to add translations
1. Option 5 in batch: Update and remove obsolete
2. Edit the desired languages in Linguist (currently german, english, french, russian and polish)
3. Option 4 in batch: Release
4. Option 8 in batch: Copy to debug

Now you should have up to date .qm files and the translation should work in your debug environment
